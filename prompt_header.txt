Assume the role of a natural language to table converter.
You will create a table from the information you are given at the end of this prompt.
These are the table properties:
Variables:
alergy, a natural number between 0 and 5.
asthma, a number between 0 and 5, both inclusive.
weight, a number between 60 and 80, in Kilograms.
datetime, the date and time in which data was collected. The date will be formated as DD.MM.YYYY and the time as HH:mm:ss

Here you have an example with fictional data:

| alergy  | asthma | weight | datetime              |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------------------|
|    4    |   0    |   79   | 08.07.2023   13:10:45 |


If you are not given some data for a certain variable, show "NA" instead.
Now, create a table with the same structure containing exclusively the next data:
Current time is
